# Privacy information
Please be noted that this privacy information may be updated without notice.

There are currently two (2) releases of ExifGlass: "Microsoft Store" and "Classic".
The Microsoft Store release is available on Microsoft Store while the Classic release is downloadable from this website.

Both releases of ExifGlass will anonymously append a query string when you open a link from the software to this website.
This allows us to count how many installations there are for each version of ExifGlass, and how many install/update
attempts were successful or not.

### Microsoft Store release
ExifGlass, as a software, does not, in any way, collect or transmit any personal information. In fact, no information
(personal or not) is ever collected or transmitted except as described in the above paragraph for the purpose of checking
for and installing updates.

### Classic release
ExifGlass, as a software, periodically checks for updates. This is done by downloading a small file from the website and
is anonymous. You can disable this from the Settings dialog.
